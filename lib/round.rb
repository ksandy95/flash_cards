#### future kelly, refactor your code for as many one liners as possible!!


class Round
  attr_reader :deck

  def initialize(deck)
    @deck = Deck.new([])
  end

  def current_card
    # need this method
  end

  def take_turn
    # need this method
  end

  def number_correct_by_category
    # need this method
    # single line method
  end

  def percent_correct
    # need this method

    # instance variable is a good idea
  end

  def percent_correct_by_category
    # need this method
  end

  def turns
    # might already have this method?
  end
end
